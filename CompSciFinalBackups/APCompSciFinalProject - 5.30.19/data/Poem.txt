Shine On, You Crazy Diamond
Remember when you were young,
You shone like the sun
Shine on you crazy diamond!
Now there's a look in your eyes,
Like black holes in the sky
Shine on you crazy diamond!
You were caught in the crossfire of childhood and stardom,
Blown on the steel breeze
~Pink Floyd

BUG LIST: (note: for bugs, not for missing features)


MISSING IMPORTANT FEATURES: (note: not the tiny things, but the really important stuff)
Frog moves on log
Scoring points
Winning when you get to the end
  When you get the end you are supposed to only go into "white" spots, but rn you can go anywhere (BAD). < -- Add special cases for movement to block going into the wrong area

Resolved bugs (but still test more):
when you're supposed to respawn, if you're colliding with an obstacle, you will "die" again, and won't respawn

MINI-FEATURES:
Frog faces different direction depending on the last direction that you moved.

Points: [Info]: 48 sec

Task list:
Finish all the classes and subclasses with interactability
  - make them fully exist
  - include motion logic
  - aaaaaa
Instantiate every class and subclass needed to run game
Texture all classes
Add frog as player
  - make the froggo
Add control systems
  - ask Kaia and implement things
Scoring systems
  - maybe highscores by: session, local, and github (overall)

Is there just one level, that is the same (aside from intro/ctrls)?

Maybe have a mini "hand" display on the side to show relative loc and stuff.



MAP LAYOUT:
X:
0-10: I guess there isn't entirely a set grid, but perhaps there are 11 across (to match the 5 endpoints, with one in between each)
-1 = off screen

Y:
0 = start (brown brick)
1 = road 1 (bottom lane) slowest
2 = road 2 (lane below double yellow) fast
3 = road 3 (lane above double yellow) middle
4 = road 4 (center lane above double yellow, below grey line) fastest
5 = road 5 (through gray line) whatever
6 = grey bricks (safe zone)
7 = water 1 (turtle) fastest spd
8 = water 2 (log) slow (/middle after, but missing a lane) spd
9 = water 3 (turle) slow+ spd
10 = water 4 (log) middle spd
11 = finish (dark grey bricks w/ holes)
-1 = off screen/error/not yet shown

Screen wrap??? (i.e. going from right edge to left by going right)


Ideas for later, if time permits:

// int global_highscore = 0; // set from a text file, that is held from a globally viewable location, i.e. on GitHub (use curl?)

  boolean isCrocodile; // maybe make (another) separate class?, there's also those bot-thingies
  
  bonuses


Notes:
  Finish areas:
    50-76
    142-170
    236-266
    331-360
    425-455
    
    48-144

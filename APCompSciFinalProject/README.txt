To start showing the poem, click to start, once you see the album cover of Shine on, You Crazy Diamond, and have been prompted to click. Interaction: On the last two screens, moving the mouse will move the leaves.

THE POEM: The “poem,” or Pink Floyd Song “Shine On, You Crazy Diamond,” will be played and displayed. It will not start from the beginning of the song (as it is heavily instrumental), and will have an approximate runtime of one minute, four seconds. Upon running the program, the program will take some time to load all images (total count of 115), and one MP3 (1.39 MB). Once loaded, you click anywhere on screen to start the display. Once the poem has finished, you may press ‘R’ to restart (and you do not need to click again).

Note: Project startup is fairly slow, expect delays. There may be some audio-screen desync, caused by external sources such as RAM allocation changing or other resources being used.

P.S.: Yes, that is a pulsar, not a black hole. It's still fancy.
